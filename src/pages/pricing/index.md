    We price our jobs by volume and weight and type of access to your items. Our
    ESTIMATES are always a GUIDELINE. Dump fees have increased at METRO.  We
    will give you a firm price on site once we have seen the items to be
    removed. If you have less, we will gladly adjust. Hazmat fees of $25 or more
    may be added depending on quantities.
  description2: >-
    $125-150 Minimum Call out for truck and 2 people.  Inner Portland Only
    (sorry no discounts on minimum hauls) Heavy or hard to donate furniture, or
    loads with mostly "junk" will land at the higher end of the price break
    downs. Stair fees start at $75.00.  Hazmats over one tub, add $35 and up. 


    We operate the largest hauling trucks in Portland-- 16' ft box trucks,
    fitted with a lift gate so we get jobs done safer and faster. Our trucks
    measure 15ft x 8ft x 7ft high.  Ours are larger than franchise hauling DUMP
    trucks.  We say NO to DUMP trucks in order to protect items which may be
    donated to local non-profits, or carefully recycled.  Our rates are still
    better and competitive with large franchised hauling firms.

        I hired Annie Haul for a major house cleanout preparing for sale in a
        very difficult situation. It was a very big job, filling one huge truck
        with donatable items and another with junk and trash. It was also a
        delicate and complex emotional situation with the owner, which Kate and
        her crew handled compassionately and competently.

        Results were excellent, communication was impeccable throughout and
        price was competitive or better, especially given how much work was
        required to gather items from througout the house so they could be
        donated rather than go to the landfill. I could not have hoped for a
        better result from the cleanout and would absolutely hire Annie Haul
        again.

        We found Annie Haul on Yelp. They turned out to be an excellent choice!
        Everybody was respectful, sensitive to our needs, and flexible.

        Our project was a difficult one, and Annie Haul made it go so much
        better than it could have gone.

        This service is so needed.   I've been trying to declutter my house for
        quite some time but got stuck with where to donate things or where to
        recycle things.   Voila, Annie Haul separates it all out and distributes
        to appropriate facilities and limits the amount that goes to landfill.  
        I feel so good.  Best check I ever writes.

        I used Annie Haul yesterday and they were awesome. They worked with me
        to ensure I was comfortable with the overall cost and were so friendly
        through the entire experience. Henry and Emily were great and
        accommodating and I would definitely use them again and I highly
        recommend them. There were going to ensure they could donate as much as
        they could too.
