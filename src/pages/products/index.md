        “Even better, they donate what they can to charities and recycle what
        can be, so little ends up in the landfill.”

        "We found Annie Haul on Yelp. They turned out to be an excellent choice!
        Everybody was respectful, sensitive to our needs, and flexible.

        Our project was a difficult one, and Annie Haul made it go so much
        better than it could have gone.

        I will be calling them again, soon!"

        I used Annie Haul yesterday and they were awesome. They worked with me
        to ensure I was comfortable with the overall cost and were so friendly
        through the entire experience. Henry and Emily were great and
        accommodating and I would definitely use them again and I highly
        recommend them. There were going to ensure they could donate as much as
        they could too.

    We price our jobs by volume and weight and type of access to your items. Our
    ESTIMATES are always a GUIDELINE. Dump fees have increased at METRO.  We
    will give you a firm price on site once we have seen the items to be
    removed. If you have less, we will gladly adjust. Hazmat fees of $25 or more
    may be added depending on quantities.

    $80-100. Inner Portland Only (sorry no discounts on minimum hauls) $35.00
    fee added for large furniture.


    We operate the largest hauling trucks in Portland-- 16' ft box trucks,
    fitted with a lift gate so we get jobs done safer and faster. Our trucks
    measure 15ft x 8ft x 7ft high.  Ours are larger than franchise hauling DUMP
    trucks.  We say NO to DUMP trucks in order to protect items which may be
    donated to local non-profits, or carefully recycled.  Our rates are still
    better and competitive with large franchised hauling firms.
