  We price our jobs by volume and weight and type of access to your items. Our
  ESTIMATES are always a GUIDELINE. Dump fees have increased at METRO.  We will
  give you a firm price on site once we have seen the items to be removed. If
  you have less, we will gladly adjust. Hazmat fees of $25 or more may be added
  depending on quantities.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

    Minimum Call Out Charge for small amounts:
      $80-100. Inner Portland Only (sorry no discounts on minimum hauls) $35.00 fee added for large furniture.

    Our Trucks:   WE PACK them, so you get the best value.

    We operate the largest hauling trucks in Portland-- 16' ft box trucks,
    fitted with a lift gate so we get jobs done safer and faster. Our trucks
    measure 15ft x 8ft x 7ft high.  Ours are larger than franchise hauling DUMP
    trucks.  We say NO to DUMP trucks in order to protect items which may be
    donated to local non-profits, or carefully recycled.  Our rates are still
    better and competitive with large franchised hauling firms.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their
      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.
