Annie Haul owners, Kate O'Halloran, and previous owner, Annie, have always proudly participated in Gay Pride events.  We have advocated for LGBTQ rights during historic, offensive,  ballot measures, and helped turn out voters. ( For over 30 years we have been knocking on doors, attending house parties, and getting out the good votes)  We love to drive our trucks in the Gay Pride Parades, and cannot wait until those events return!  Until then, THANK you to Our Community. 

 We have been there for you, and you have been there for us. We are the Original Woman Owned, LGBTW owned, GREEN HAULING COMPANY.  

Annie Haul "Hauler's with a Conscience"  Donate, recycle, re-use.  Landfill is our last stop.
