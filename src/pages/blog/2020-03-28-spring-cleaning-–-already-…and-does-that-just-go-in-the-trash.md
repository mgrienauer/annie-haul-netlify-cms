Annie Haul has been hauling! In a time of reduce, reuse and recycle, we are honored to be part of the cycle with you. When you call Annie Haul, you’re not calling a dump truck. We show up at your location with our clean box truck, and we sort your stuff according to how it will be repurposed, reused, recycled and otherwise complete its lifecycle.



There are so many ways that “stuff” builds up in our lives. Maybe you recently “KonMari’d” your home, or upgrading your office furniture. Whatever your reason, Annie Haul is ready for you! Don’t let other companies greenwash you into their dump trucks. We know you want to keep as much stuff out of the landfill as we do – because that’s what we do and we are in this together.



One of the reasons people call us is that they’re simply looking to minimize their clutter and reduce their consumer habits. If you’re looking to actively participate in the reduce, reuse and recycle strategy to clean up our environment – and you’re starting with you – let us help.



Once something goes into a dump truck, it cannot no longer be donated to a non-profit. We at Annie Haul understand that items donated to non-profits must be in good, useable condition. We donated with dignity, both directly to people who need it and to local non-profits.



You probably already know that the couch cannot be donated though… can it be recycled? Yes! Annie Haul will remove it from your location for you – and you can rest easy knowing it has been recycled.



Not sure how something can be recycled or reused if we take it? Call us and ask! From the chair that the cat destroyed, to the microwave that doesn’t work or the box your new big screen TV came in, just call Annie Haul at 503-477-4941 to take it away for you.
