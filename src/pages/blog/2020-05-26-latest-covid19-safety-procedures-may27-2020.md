 We are continuing with COVID 19 Safety measures throughout the Tri-County Area we serve. We are now able to enter homes, offices, and businesses with some restrictions.  Masks and gloves are worn by all parties, clients and crews, with safe distancing practiced. Please call with questions or concerns, and for scheduling options. All donation worthy items are being stored in our huge facilities until the local non-profits are reopened and able to accept your items. Of course we are still a ONE CALL HAUL; donations, recycling, electronics, and good ol' JUNK.  Thank you for your support, always, but especially now.  Kate O'Halloran, Owner.
