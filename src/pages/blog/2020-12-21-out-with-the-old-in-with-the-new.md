2020 has been a very busy year for us.  Thank you for all of your support!!  We have managed to keep our employees and clients safe, and still donate, literally TONS and TONS of usable items to our wonderful, local non-profits and local artists. 

Annie Haul has kept *TONS* of items, which other haulers toss into the dump, out of the landfill, too!  So many people at home, creating usable, clear space to school children,  making space for new home offices, and offices moving out of Portland contributed to our very busy service.  This burst of activity was a very welcome surprise and twist to the Covid 19 troubles. Our good fortune though, makes me all the more aware of the hardships others have and are, enduring. 

We have donated two player pianos, 5 upright pianos, and one baby grand to artists this year, alone.  My mother would roll over in her grave if I ever tossed one in the dump-- regular practice by some franchise haulers.  It has been said pianos are the "fruit-cake" of Craig's List-- sadly out of favor.  If we have to, we will take them apart, so that any valuables, ivory, cables, pedals, precious woods and metals, go to artists.

It has been challenging for us to keep the donation flow going as our non-profits struggle with Covid 19 Mandates, staffing, etc.  I have rented storage to hold items when we get bogged down, so far, so good!!!  All usable items get to them eventually. 

As the holidays approach, if you wish to say "OUT with the OLD in with the NEW" -- Give ANNIE HAUL A CALL.  ONE CALL HAULING.  WOMEN OWNED. LOCAL. 503-477-4941

We recycle packaging, as well as Styro-foam.

Wishing everyone a festive and safe holiday, New Year, and Happy Winter Solstice.
