Annie Haul has a great reputation in the Portland Metro Area.  For over 20 years we have been dedicated to keeping anything possible out of the dump.  We have formed lasting relationships with our local non-profits and we are very proud of that. Our crews are professional and kind.  We are highly recommended by Community Warehouse, and work closely with local Portland artists, Habitat for Humanity, Dignity Village, ARC, PAC and so many more! We operate with integrity and full transparency with pricing.
