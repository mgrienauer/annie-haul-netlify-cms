  We took an entire truck full of StyroFoam to be recycled last week. During the
  year, we take an average of 10 truck loads to be recycled! That is almost
  8,000 SQ FT, kept out of our landfills where it never goes "away".  In
  addition we have been delivering oddities and curiosities to RE-CLAIM IT (
  www.reclaimitpdx.org) These artists are happy to see ANNIE HAUL, as they are
  not allowed to "glean" the dump for goodies during Covid 19.

We are thrilled to bring things to the Artists at RE-CLAIM It.  Last months we took them a vintage pedal organ, it was a beauty. Plus so much more!  Annie Haul crews are dedicated to keeping cool things out of the dump.  We literally go the extra mile to get things to those who can use them, yet keep our rates competitive with large franchise dump truck "junk haulers".
