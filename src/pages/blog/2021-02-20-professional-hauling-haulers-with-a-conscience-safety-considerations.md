Annie haul is woman owned and operated. Local. We have been serving the Portland Metro Area for over 20 years!  Things to consider when hiring a hauling service:   We are licensed, that means we have liability insurance.... why would you let someone in your home, on your steps, on your hardwood floors, without insurance? All of our teams member pass background check... why would you let some one in your home or on your property with out that? Our services include donating your usable items, ALWAYS.  We go the extra mile to keep items from the landfill. We work with all the local non-profits, and are recommended by them.  We are first on the list of recommendations by realtors, too.   Our trucks are also equipped with lift gates.  Thank you for your business! Kate O'Halloran, Owner.
