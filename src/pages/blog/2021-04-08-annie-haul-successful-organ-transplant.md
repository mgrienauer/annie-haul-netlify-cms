This week we managed to get another vintage pump style organ, beautiful, to local non-profit thrift store ( PAC) and SO much more!  We continue to take truck loads of very wonderful items to Community Ware House, Habitat for Humanity, PAC ( Portland Adventists) Re-Claim it, Dignity Village, Mississippi Rebuilding and more!  Or commitment to keep usable stuff out of the dump is REAL.  We thank our great customers for generously donating to our LOCAL community.  It just feel so good!
