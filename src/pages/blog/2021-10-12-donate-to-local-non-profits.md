We truly thank our clients for keeping Annie Haul so busy during these times.

It has been challenging to find homes for donations, slowing down our operations, but we have managed to adapt-- like everyone.  Metro landfill has also drastically increased "dumping" fees. We have held our pricing to a very competitive rate, all the same.

We have Covid Safety measures still in place, and our professional teams voluntarily vaccinated.

We are also short-staffed, again, like so many other businesses, so at this time we are running trucks 4 days a week rather than our normal 6.

We are booking up quickly every week, so please call well in advance of when you may need our services.

We are operating Monday-Thursday for pick ups, however the phones and emails are monitored each day.

Thank you, again, for your support and understanding and patience. We strive to provide the best hauling experience in the Portland Metro Area.  We appreciate you.

Kate O'Halloran.

Owner, Annie Haul
