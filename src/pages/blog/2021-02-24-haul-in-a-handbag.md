 Soon our truck will be parking in neighborhood locations and giving away, yes, free, all kinds of cool items from clothing to small furniture, household items and oddities. Keep watch for out for Haul in a Handbag (www.haulinahandbag.com) We will "Bing" our locations on local Buy Nothing websites, ETC.  This will be fun!
