We were playing a new tune this week.  We delivered a beautiful player piano and all the rolls of music to Re-claim it yesterday. ( First we had to get it down 12 concrete steps!) Our client was thrilled that their deceased partner's player was going someplace cool.  We were delighted, too. We ALSO brought Re-Claim It a Grand Piano this week.  It will be parted out and artists will make everything from furniture to earrings out of it.  Annie Haul donated literally tons of items to Community Warehouse, Portland Adventists and Habitat for Humanity this month.  Keep it up!  Give us a call.  Thank you for your business.  Annie Haul is woman owned, locally owned, not a franchise and we REALLY donate.
