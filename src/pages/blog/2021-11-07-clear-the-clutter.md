  Annie Haul is staffing back up!  This is great news for us, and hopefully for
  you too.  Soon we will be able to offer our great service 6 days per week,
  rather than 4.

Do you need to clear out space for the holidays?  Please give us a call.  We are thrilled to have maintained our A+ Rating with the Better Business Bureau, and to have been Awarded Neighbor Hood Favorite with Nextdoor.  Thank you.

We have currently stopped recycling Styrofoam.  We just don't have the room to store it any longer, or the ability to transport it effeciently.  Please take your Styrofoam to AGYLIX in TIGARD, OR. They have a free drop off.

We were happy to provide that service for over 4 years thereby keeping tons of styrofoam out of our landfills.
