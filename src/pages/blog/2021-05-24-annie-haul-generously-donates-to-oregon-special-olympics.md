My  big brother, John J O'Halloran ( III) was so proud to participate in the Oregon Special Olympics.  He participated as an adult in track and field and softball.  He was never able to play in school sports like his brothers and sisters, but he was our greatest fan. He found the Oregon Special Olympics as an adult.  I will never forget watching these events and his pride and joy when earning his medals. These athletes are truly inspirational.  Thank you to our clients who help me make these donations possible, and I encourage you to donate when you are able.  This last year with Covid19 has been especially challenging for participants, in many ways,  but they are able to keep involved virtually with our help. Thank you, Kate O'Halloran, owner, Annie Haul.
